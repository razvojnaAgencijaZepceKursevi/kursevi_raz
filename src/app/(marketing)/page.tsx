/**
 * The landing page — `/`.
 *
 * ## It used to redirect to /login, and that was the biggest hole in the app
 *
 * A visitor who typed the domain got a login form: no way to find out what the
 * platform was, and no route to the catalogue that had been public all along.
 * This replaces it with a real entry point.
 *
 * ## Structure now, copy later
 *
 * The sections below are the skeleton — a hero, what a course involves, and a
 * closing call to action. The wording is placeholder marketing text and is
 * expected to be rewritten; the *shape* is what was missing. Unlike the legal
 * pages it is not left empty, because a blank home page is worse than a
 * provisional one, and nothing here can mislead anybody the way invented terms
 * of service could.
 *
 * ## The sections are bands, not a column
 *
 * Every section is a full-width `<Section>` with a surface of its own, and the
 * tones alternate — plain, tint, paper, plain, paper, plain, brand. That
 * alternation is what gives the page a vertical rhythm; there are no dividers
 * between sections any more, because the edge of a band already separates it
 * from the next one. Add a section in the middle and pick the tone its
 * neighbours do not have.
 *
 * A Server Component: apart from `<FeaturedCourses>`, which needs a query, and
 * the reveal-on-scroll wrappers inside each section, the first page a stranger
 * sees is static and fully crawlable.
 *
 * Open question left for the owner: what a **signed-in** visitor should see
 * here — this page, or a redirect to `landingPathForRole`. Right now they get
 * this page, and the header already offers the way into their own area.
