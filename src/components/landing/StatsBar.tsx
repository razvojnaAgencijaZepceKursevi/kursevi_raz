/**
 * Row of headline stats, shown directly under the hero.
 *
 * The figures come from `SITE.stats` in `src/lib/siteConfig.ts`. An empty
 * list renders nothing, which is how to hide the band until there are real
 * numbers to show.
 *
 * ## It used to be invisible
 *
 * The strip was painted `grey.50` (#fafafa) on a `background.default` page
 * (#f7f8fa). Those are the same colour to any eye, so what was meant to read as
 * a band read as four numbers loose on the page — and with only `pt` set, the
 * band ended flush against the bottom of the labels. It is now a `tint`
 * `<Section>`: a faint wash of the brand colour, which is the one place on the
 * page that gets it, and hairline rules between the figures so the four read as
 * a set rather than as a row of unrelated facts.
 *
 * Used once, directly after `<Hero />` in `(marketing)/page.tsx`.
