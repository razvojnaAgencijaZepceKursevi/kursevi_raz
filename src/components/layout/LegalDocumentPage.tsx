/**
 * Renders one legal document from the database (migration 0030).
 *
 * Shared by `/uvjeti-koristenja` and `/politika-privatnosti`, which differ only
 * in which row they ask for — the rest of the page is identical, and two copies
 * would drift.
 *
 * ## A Server Component
 *
 * This was a Client Component fetching through React Query, which meant the
 * text arrived only after hydration and the server sent a page with nothing in
 * it. Wrong twice over for a legal document: a crawler sees an empty page, and
 * a reader whose JavaScript is slow or blocked is shown a shell where the
 * agreement should be.
 *
 * It reads on the server now, so the text is in the initial HTML — confirmed by
 * asserting against the raw response rather than by looking at a browser, which
 * is the only way to tell the two apart.
 *
 * ## An empty document says so
 *
 * Both rows are seeded with empty content, so "not written yet" is a real state
 * rather than an error. It renders as a notice, never as a blank page: an
 * apparently-complete but empty terms page is worse than an honest placeholder,
 * because a visitor would take it as the actual agreement.
 *
 * The text is Markdown, rendered by `<MarkdownContent>` — the same renderer the
 * blog uses and the same one the admin editor previews with, so what an admin
 * approved in the editor is what appears here.
