/**
 * A Markdown editor with a toolbar, for people who do not know Markdown.
 *
 * ## What it stores
 *
 * Raw Markdown, always. The toolbar inserts syntax into the text rather than
 * maintaining a separate document model, so `value` is exactly what goes into
 * the database and exactly what `<MarkdownContent>` renders. Nothing is
 * converted on the way in or out.
 *
 * That is why this is a Markdown editor and not a WYSIWYG one: a rich-text
 * editor like TipTap is HTML-native, so storing Markdown would mean converting
 * both ways and losing fidelity on every round trip. Keeping the stored form
 * portable also matters because the blog is earmarked to move to `.md` files on
 * disk if it grows.
 *
 * ## The preview is ours, not the library's
 *
 * `components.preview` overrides `@uiw/react-md-editor`'s built-in renderer
 * with `<MarkdownContent>` — the same component the blog and the legal pages
 * use. So the preview pane is not an approximation of the published page, it is
 * the published page's own code path.
 *
 * Two things follow. An author cannot be misled by a preview that styles things
 * differently from the live site. And the library's renderer, which allows raw
 * HTML by default and would need `rehype-sanitize` bolted on, never runs at
 * all — the security question is answered by not having a second renderer
 * rather than by configuring one.
 *
 * ## Images are pasted, dropped, or neither
 *
 * `allowImages` turns on paste and drop handling: the file is uploaded and
 * `![alt](url)` is appended. It is opt-in because the two callers differ — a
 * newsletter is emailed, so its images must live at a public URL a mail client
 * can fetch anonymously, while the legal documents are rendered in-app and have
 * no such need. Turning it on where it is not wanted would put an upload
 * affordance on a screen with nowhere sensible to put the file.
 *
 * ## Why the dynamic import
 *
 * The editor touches `window` at module scope, so it must never reach a server
 * render. `ssr: false` is required, not a bundle-size optimisation — without it
 * the page 500s on the server.
