/**
 * The section switcher for `/settings`.
 *
 * ## Links, not local state
 *
 * Each tab is a real `<Tab component={NextLink} href>`, so every section keeps
 * its own URL and stays bookmarkable, linkable and reachable by the back
 * button. Client-side tab state would collapse the three into one address and
 * lose that — the same reasoning that split the student dashboard into pages
 * rather than sections of one screen.
 *
 * What was messy was the *navigation*, not the URLs: two separate entries in
 * the account menu for what is obviously one screen. One entry now, three tabs
 * under it.
 *
 * `Tab` is not `MenuItem` — it has no `'li'` root override, so the theme's
 * global `LinkComponent` would cover it. It is written out anyway because this
 * is a Client Component and being explicit here costs nothing; see `theme.ts`
 * for why the distinction matters.
 *
 * The list comes from `SETTINGS_SECTIONS`, which drops any tab whose feature is
 * switched off.
