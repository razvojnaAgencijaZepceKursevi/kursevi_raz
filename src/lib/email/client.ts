/**
 * The one place that talks to Resend.
 *
 * ## Not being configured is a normal state, not a failure
 *
 * There is no Resend account yet, so `RESEND_API_KEY` is empty and every send
 * short-circuits into a log line. That is deliberate and it is the whole
 * arrangement: everything upstream — preferences, templates, recipients, the
 * call sites — is wired as though mail were already going out, and plugging in
 * a real key is the only remaining step.
 *
 * It also means the same code path runs in development without anyone
 * accidentally emailing real students while clicking around the seeded data.
 *
 * ## This never throws
 *
 * A send failure must not turn a successful purchase approval into a 500. The
 * caller gets an outcome to log, not an exception to handle — see
 * `src/lib/services/notifications.ts`, which is already running after the
 * response has gone out.
