/**
 * Telling people that something happened.
 *
 * ## Two channels, one decision point
 *
 * A notification is a row in `notifications` (the in-app bell) and, separately,
 * an email. `notification_preferences` decides each independently, per user per
 * type, and **a missing preference row means both are on** — see migration
 * 0025 for why the table is sparse.
 *
 * ## It runs after the response, and it cannot fail the request
 *
 * `notifyUsers` is scheduled with `after()` from `next/server`, so it happens
 * once the response has already gone to the client. Two reasons, and both are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **latency.** Approving a purchase should not wait on an SMTP round trip.
 *   - **blast radius.** A notification is a side effect of an action that has
 *     already succeeded. If Resend is down, the purchase is still approved; a
 *     throw here must never turn that into a 500 and invite the admin to press
 *     the button again.
 *
 * Everything inside is therefore wrapped and logged rather than thrown. The
 * failure mode is a missing notification, which is recoverable, instead of a
 * failed mutation, which may not be.
