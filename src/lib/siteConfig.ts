/**
 * Site-wide facts: the brand, how to reach us, who we legally are.
 *
 * ## Why this is a file and not environment variables
 *
 * Everything here is the same in every environment — local, Vercel preview and
 * production all show the same phone number — and all of it is public. Env vars
 * earn their place when a value is secret or differs per deployment; neither is
 * true here. As env vars these would be untyped strings, copied by hand into
 * three Vercel environments, edited in a dashboard with no review, and still
 * needing a redeploy to change (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time). As a
 * file they are typed, reviewed like any other copy, and changed in one place.
 *
 * The test for adding something: **would it ever differ between preview and
 * production, or must it stay secret?** If yes, it belongs in `.env.example`.
 * If no, it belongs here.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * - **Payment details** (recipient, bank, account number) live in the database
 *   (`payment_settings`, edited at `/admin/settings/payment`). An admin must be
 *   able to correct an account number without a deploy.
 * - **Terms and privacy policy** — also the database (`/admin/settings/legal`),
 *   for the same reason.
 * - **Course categories in the footer** come from the `categories` table, so
 *   adding a category in `/admin/categories` is all it takes.
 * - **Section copy** (hero, how it works, FAQ answers…) stays in its
 *   component under `src/components/landing/`. This file holds the *facts* that
 *   copy quotes, so a fact quoted in several places changes once.
 *
 * Values marked `PLACEHOLDER` must be replaced before launch.
