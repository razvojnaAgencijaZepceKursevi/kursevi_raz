 * The rules of the public certificate check (`/provjera-certifikata`).

 * a pair that matches is confirmed. The number alone is not enough because
 * numbers are sequential (CERT-2026-0001, 0002, …): a number-only lookup would
 * let anyone walk the range and harvest every graduate's name and course. The
 * people this page is for — an employer reading a CV — already have both.
 *
 * Plain functions, no dependencies: shared by the route (the real check), the
 * form (input format) and the certificate page (building the shareable link),
 * so the three cannot disagree about what matches.
