/**
 * Feature flags, for showing the product in stages.
 *
 * The app is finished; these exist so it can be *presented* a segment at a
 * time — turn one on every few weeks, and with everything on it behaves exactly
 * as it does with no flags at all.
 *
 * ## Default on, not default off
 *
 * A flag that is absent means **enabled**. Only the literal string `"false"`
 * turns something off.
 *
 * The alternative — default off — would mean a fresh clone, a CI run or a
 * forgotten variable in a new environment silently ships a crippled app, and
 * every deploy target would have to list every flag to get the normal product.
 * Defaulting on means the flags are a deliberate subtraction from a working
 * whole, which is what they are. It also makes the promise easy to keep: delete
 * the variables and everything is back.
 *
 * ## They must be `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
 *
 * Next inlines these at build time, and only variables with that prefix reach
 * the browser. A flag read in a Client Component (most of this app) would be
 * `undefined` without it, so the feature would look enabled on the server and
 * disabled on the client — or the reverse. The whole file is therefore written
 * with **literal** `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_…` reads: Next substitutes them
 * textually, so `process.env[someVariable]` does not work and would silently
 * evaluate to undefined.
 *
 * ## What a flag does and does not do
 *
 * A flag hides a feature: its nav entries, its pages, and the UI that leads to
 * it. **It is not access control.** The API routes and RLS policies are
 * unchanged, so a flag being off does not make an endpoint unreachable to
 * someone who types the URL — it makes the product not offer it. That is the
 * right level for a staged demo, and the wrong level for security; nothing here
 * is protecting anything.
