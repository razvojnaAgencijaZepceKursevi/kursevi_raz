/**
 * The tabs under `/settings`, minus any whose feature is switched off.
 *
 * Lives in `lib/` rather than in `<SettingsTabs>` because the index page — a
 * Server Component — needs the list too, and importing a plain value out of a
 * `'use client'` module hands a Server Component a client reference rather than
 * the array.
 *
 * Every section belongs to a flag, so this can be empty. When it is, the
 * account menu drops "Podešavanja" and `/settings` 404s, rather than opening a
 * screen with no tabs on it.
