 * raise a toast are mutation callbacks and event handlers, not render bodies.
 * Reading the store imperatively via `getState()` means `toast.success(...)`
 * works from anywhere without a hook, a provider, or prop-drilling.
 *
 * Render side lives in `<ToastHost />`, mounted once in the root layout.
