/**
 * Holds public pages in the light scheme for signed-out visitors, whatever their
 * OS or stored preference. Signed-in users get their own scheme everywhere.
 *
 * The rule and the reasoning live in `colorSchemeRules.ts`; this is the half
 * that survives client-side navigation. The inline script in the root layout
 * covers the first paint of a hard load — a route change re-renders the tree
 * without re-running any script, so this takes over from there.
 *
 * ## Why a MutationObserver rather than just setting the class
 *
 * `<html>`'s class belongs to MUI: its provider re-asserts it whenever the
 * colour scheme changes, and it does so from an effect in an **ancestor** of
 * this component. React runs child effects before parent ones, so writing the
 * class from here would simply be overwritten a moment later — most visibly
 * when `<ThemeSync>` applies a signed-in user's stored `dark` after the
 * preferences query resolves, mid-visit, on a public page.
 *
 * Observing the attribute inverts that: whoever writes last, this has the final
 * word. The callback runs as a microtask, so the correction lands before the
 * browser gets a chance to paint the wrong scheme.
 *
 * ## Why not `setMode('light')`
 *
 * Because that is the *user's* setting, and it persists — to localStorage
 * immediately and, through `<ThemeToggle>`, to `user_preferences`. Visiting the
 * landing page must not rewrite someone's chosen theme. Nothing here touches
 * MUI's state at all; it only overrides how this one page is painted, which is
 * why leaving for a gated page can restore the scheme exactly.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Deliberately separate from `<ThemeSync>`: that one applies
 * the account's saved preference, this one decides whether the current page
 * listens to it.
