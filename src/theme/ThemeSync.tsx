/**
 * Applies the signed-in user's saved colour scheme.
 *
 * ## Two layers, on purpose
 *
 * MUI already persists the mode to `localStorage`, which makes a toggle
 * instant and survives a reload. That is the *fast* layer and it is enough on
 * one device. This component is the *durable* layer: the preference is also a
 * row in `user_preferences`, so signing in on another machine brings the choice
 * along instead of reverting to the OS default.
 *
 * ## Why the database only ever wins once
 *
 * It applies the stored value when it arrives and then stays out of the way —
 * the effect depends on the fetched value, not on `mode`. If it re-asserted on
 * every render, toggling the switch would fight the last fetched value and snap
 * back. The toggle writes to both layers itself (see `<ThemeToggle>`), so after
 * the first application the two agree.
 *
 * Renders nothing. It sits inside the providers in the root layout because it
 * needs both `useColorScheme` and React Query.
